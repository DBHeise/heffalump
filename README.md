# heffalump
Heffalump is an endless honeypot that gives malicious bots nightmares. To use, in your robots.txt tell robots not to go to a certain URL, which heffalump is reverse proxying. Any web agent that does go to the URL will receive an endless stream of random data, which will overflow its memory and/or storage if it doesn't have a max buffer size set.

## Todo

Everything. I'm starting this repo just to make myself remember the idea.
